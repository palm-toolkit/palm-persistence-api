# PALM

## Personal Academic Learner Model

**PALM** is a web based personal lifelong learner model developed in Learning Technologies Research Group i9 of RWTH-Aachen University. The main goal of PALM is to provide comprehensive information to researchers regarding the development of their lifelong learning. 

PALM collects academic publications from many sources, then combines and filters this information into more complete and comprehensive one. PALM applies several data mining techniques to extract some facts that related to researcher interests and the evolution of researcher interests.

Moreover, PALM not only provides comprehensive information about researchers, but also their publications and venues (conferences / journal) where those publications published. In the future, PALM will also offer recommendation and prediction systems that related to researcher interests.
